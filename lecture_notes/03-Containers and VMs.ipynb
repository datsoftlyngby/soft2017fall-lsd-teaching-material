    "\n",
    "  > A hypervisor or virtual machine monitor (VMM) is computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a host machine, and each virtual machine is called a guest machine. The hypervisor presents the guest operating systems with a virtual operating platform and manages the execution of the guest operating systems. Multiple instances of a variety of operating systems may share the virtualized hardware resources: for example, Linux, Windows, and macOS instances can all run on a single physical x86 machine. This contrasts with operating-system-level virtualization, where all instances (usually called containers) must share a single kernel, though the guest operating systems can differ in user space, such as different Linux distributions with the same kernel.

These processes run like native processes, and you can manage them individually by running commands like `docker ps`—just like you would run `ps` on Linux to see active processes.

    "# Hands-on VMs with Vagrant\n",
    "\n",
    "  > Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and makes the \"works on my machine\" excuse a relic of the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "  > Vagrant provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments built on top of industry-standard technology and controlled by a single consistent workflow to help maximize the productivity and flexibility of you and your team. (https://www.vagrantup.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro to Vagrant\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialize & Start a VM\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start your setup by creating a `Vagrantfile`. The argument to `vagrant init` is the name of the *box*. That is, \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mkdir vm\n",
    "$ cd vm\n",
    "$ vagrant init bento/ubuntu-16.04\n",
    "$ vagrant up\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  > After running the above commands, you will have a fully functional VM in VirtualBox running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit. You can SSH into this machine with vagrant ssh, and when you are done playing around, you can terminate the virtual machine with vagrant destroy.\n",
    "  \n",
    "You can find a catalogue of available boxes at https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, you can quickly setup development environments for many operating systems. For example, in the following the initialization and use of a FreeBSD and Windows VM.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mkdir vm_freebsd\n",
    "$ cd vm_freebsd\n",
    "$ vagrant init freebsd/FreeBSD-11.0-STABLE\n",
    "$ vagrant up\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mkdir vm_win\n",
    "$ cd vm\n",
    "$ vagrant init opentable/win-2012r2-standard-amd64-nocm\n",
    "$ vagrant up\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**OBS:** From now on there are no excuses anymore like: *\"I have a Windows laptop and cannot do that Linux exercise...\"*!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing a VM\n",
    "\n",
    "You log onto a VM with SSH as in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ vagrant ssh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can leave the guest VM with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vagrant@vagrant $ exit\n",
    "$ \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Teardown\n",
    "\n",
    "You can put a running VM \n",
    "\n",
    "  * to sleep \n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  vagrant suspend\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * turn it off \n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  vagrant halt\n",
    "  ``` \n",
    "  * or remove it completely \n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  vagrant destroy\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different Providers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we always used VirtualBox as a provider. However, you can use many other, such as _VMWare_. But more importanlty, you can provision your VMs also to remote servers in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ vagrant up --provider=digital_ocean\n",
    "$ vagrant up --provider=aws\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line would deploy your VM as droplet on DigitalOcean (https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/vagrant-digitalocean) and the second line would do similarly on Amazon AWS (https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Closer Look to a Vagrantfile\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Vagrantfile` is just a Ruby script. That is, you write code to specify your development infrastructure.\n",
    "A provision script can be a plain shell script or one of many other solutions, such as [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/), [Puppet](https://www.puppetlabs.com/puppet), or [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we will use only Bash scripts for provisioning in the lecture. In your project you can apply whatever suits you best.\n",

Additionally, `-p 8080:8080` tells Docker to forward the port `8080` from the container to the same port number on our host. The port number in front of `:` specifies the port on the host, which gets bound to which port of the container (number after `:`). Finally, we run the program within the container `go run basic_http_server.go`.\n",
